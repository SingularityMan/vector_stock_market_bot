While there are some positive news and trends that could support the stock's performance, there are also potential risks associated with a recession. Traders should carefully weigh these factors before making any investment decisions.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n* Monitor TNA's performance closely in response to the interest rate cut and economic developments.\n* Consider using TNA as a tool for traders who want to capitalize on small-cap market movements, but be aware of the potential risks associated with leveraged ETFs.\n* Diversify your portfolio by investing in other assets that are less correlated with small-cap stocks.",
