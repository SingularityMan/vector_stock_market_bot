In 2023, the EPS estimates were not available for Q1 and Q2, but the actual EPS was $1.53 and $1.43 respectively. The stock's price movement is not provided in the data.\n\nIn 2024, the EPS estimates were available for Q1 and Q2, with actual EPS of $3.07 and $2.05 respectively. This indicates a strong performance by the company in terms of earnings.\n\n**News Analysis:**\n\nThe news analysis suggests that SLG has had several positive developments recently:\n\n* The company has beaten EPS estimates in two consecutive quarters (Q1 2024 and Q2 2024).\n* The dividend announcements indicate a stable financial position for the company.\n* Analyst ratings suggest a mixed view on the stock, with one bullish, one somewhat bullish, no indifferent, three somewhat bearish, and one bearish rating.\n\nHowever, there are also some negative developments:\n\n* The EPS estimate for Q3 2024 was missed by $0.07.\n* The CRE market has likely bottomed out, but a full recovery is still some distance away, which may impact SLG's performance.\n\n**Weighted Analysis:**\n\nGiven the equal weight to both news and stock performance, here are the weighted analysis results:\n\n* EPS estimates beating actual values in two consecutive quarters (Q1 2024 and Q2 2024) - 0.8\n* Dividend announcements indicating a stable financial position for the company - 0.7\n* Analyst ratings suggesting a mixed view on the stock - 0.5\n* EPS estimate miss in Q3 2024 - 0.3\n* CRE market likely to recover slowly - 0.2\n\nThe weighted score is 1.5 out of 2, indicating a positive outlook for SLG.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nBased on the analysis, I recommend buying SLG stock with a medium-term perspective (6-12 months). The company's strong earnings performance and stable financial position make it an attractive investment opportunity. However, investors should be aware of the potential risks associated with the CRE market recovery and EPS estimate misses in future quarters.\n\n**Target Price:**\n\nBased on the average price target of $47.0 from analyst ratings, I recommend a target price of $45-$50 for SLG stock over the next 6-12 months.",
